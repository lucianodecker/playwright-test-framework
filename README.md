# Playwright Test Automation Framework

![E2E & Accessibility Tests](https://github.com/lucianodecker/playwright-test-framework/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)

End-to-end test automation framework built with **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. Covers a complete e-commerce purchase flow, automated WCAG 2.2 accessibility compliance scanning, and a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

**System Under Test:** [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) — a sample e-commerce application by Sauce Labs.

---

## Highlights

- **26 automated tests** across 5 test suites (Login, Inventory, Cart, Checkout, Accessibility)
- **Page Object Model** with abstract base class and composition-based components
- **WCAG 2.2 accessibility scanning** with known violation tracking and canary tests
- **Storage State authentication** — login once, reuse across all tests
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions, secrets management, and artifact retention
- **Automated A11y reporting** — structured JSON reports generated on every violation

## Architecture Decisions

### Page Object Model with Abstract Base Class

Every page extends `BasePage`, which enforces a `path` property and provides shared navigation via `goto()`. This guarantees consistent navigation behavior across all pages and eliminates duplicated setup code.

### Composition over Inheritance

Shared UI elements like the site header are extracted into reusable components (`HeaderComponent`) rather than placed in a base class. Pages compose their components:

```typescript
public readonly header: HeaderComponent;
constructor(page: Page) {
    super(page);
    this.header = new HeaderComponent(page);
}
```

This avoids deep inheritance chains and keeps each class focused on a single responsibility.

### Storage State Authentication

Tests reuse a saved browser state instead of logging in before every test. A dedicated `auth.setup.ts` runs once, saves the authenticated state, and all subsequent tests load it. Login-specific tests run in a separate Playwright project without stored state to ensure correct isolation.

### Known Violations Tracking with Canary Tests

Accessibility violations that cannot be fixed (e.g., third-party components) are documented in a `KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` registry with rule ID, reason, WCAG criterion, discovery date, and ticket URL. A **canary test** verifies each known violation still exists — if the upstream bug gets fixed, the canary fails, signaling the team to clean up the registry. This prevents stale documentation and ensures audit compliance.

```typescript
const KNOWN_VIOLATIONS: readonly KnownViolation[] = [
    {
        ruleId: 'select-name',
        reason: 'Third-party app - cannot fix.',
        wcagCriterion: 'wcag2a, wcag412',
        foundDate: '18.02.2026',
        ticketUrl: '',
    },
];
```

### Automated A11y Report Generation

When violations are detected, a structured JSON report is written to `test-results/a11y-reports/`. Each report entry includes rule ID, severity, description, help URL, WCAG tags, affected HTML elements, and status (KNOWN or NEW). Reports are uploaded as CI artifacts for audit trails.

### Environment Variables & Secrets Management

Credentials are never hardcoded. Locally, they are loaded from `.env` via dotenv. In CI, they are injected through GitHub Actions repository secrets at job level. A fail-fast validation throws immediately if required variables are missing — tests never run with undefined credentials.

## Test Coverage

| Suite | Tests | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Login | 4 | Valid/invalid credentials, empty fields, error messages |
| Inventory | 5 | Product display, sorting, add/remove cart items |
| Cart | 6 | Navigation, product details, price validation, multi-item |
| Checkout | 7 | Form validation, complete purchase flow, cancel navigation |
| Accessibility | 3 | WCAG 2.2 scans (login + inventory), canary test |
| **Total** | **25** | **+ 1 auth setup** |

---

## WCAG Compliance

This framework scans against the following WCAG standards:

| Standard | Tags | Status |
|---|---|---|
| WCAG 2.0 Level A & AA | `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa` | ✅ Scanned |
| WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA | `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa` | ✅ Scanned (current EU standard via EN 301 549) |
| WCAG 2.2 Level AA | `wcag22aa` | ✅ Scanned (upcoming EU standard) |

Automated scanning catches approximately 30–40% of WCAG issues (technical violations like missing labels, contrast, ARIA). Manual testing is required for complete compliance coverage.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

1. **Install** — deterministic `npm ci` from lockfile
2. **Test** — full E2E and accessibility suite
3. **Artifacts** — Playwright HTML report + A11y JSON reports (60-day retention)

Credentials are managed through GitHub repository secrets. The pipeline uses `ubuntu-latest` with a single worker for deterministic test execution.
